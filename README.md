# Java Studies Repository

This repository serves as a centralized and organized record of my learning journey in the Java language. The goal is to document my progress, from basic concepts to advanced topics.

All source code is located inside the `/src` folder.

## 📂 Repository Structure

The code is organized by fundamental programming concepts and paradigms:

### 📊 /src/Arrays
Contains **6 exercises** focusing on array manipulation, including:
- Array selection and traversal
- Statistical calculations (averages)
- Practical applications (banknote counting)
- Fundamental array operations

### 🔀 /src/Conditionals
Includes **9 exercises** covering conditional structures:
- If-else statements
- Switch-case constructs
- Ternary operators
- Complex decision-making logic

### 🔄 /src/Loops
Features **11 exercises** exploring iteration structures:
- For loops
- While loops
- Do-while loops
- Nested loops and complex iterations
- Real-world problem-solving (e.g., Identifying Tea)

### 🎯 /src/Oop
Comprises **9 project folders** demonstrating Object-Oriented Programming principles:
- `Bank_Account` - Banking system simulation
- `Dollar` - Currency conversion
- `Heron_Formula` - Geometric calculations
- `Rectangle` - Shape modeling
- `Salary` - Employee compensation management
- `Sphere` - 3D geometry
- `Stock` & `Stock_2` - Inventory management systems
- `Student` - Academic records management

Each project implements key OOP concepts like encapsulation, classes, objects, constructors, and methods.

### ⚡ /src/Sequentially
Provides **6 exercises** on sequential programming:
- Basic input/output operations
- Sequential logic flow
- Step-by-step problem solving
- Fundamental algorithmic thinking

## 🎯 Objective

To maintain an organized history of my studies, facilitate future reference, and publicly demonstrate my dedication and evolution in the Java language and development ecosystem.

## 📊 Statistics

- **Total exercises:** 41 individual files + 9 OOP projects
- **Topics covered:** Arrays, Conditionals, Loops, OOP, Sequential Programming
- **Focus:** Practical problem-solving and hands-on learning
